## Design Patterns and Architecture

The project structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebase. Here's a breakdown of the design patterns and architecture:

### Model
- **api_repository.dart:** Manages data operations and interacts with external data sources, such as APIs.

### View
- **pages/home_screen.dart:** Contains UI components and defines the main screen layout.

### Controller
- **controller/home_controller.dart:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling business logic and coordinating interactions.

### Binding
- **utils/binding/home_binding.dart:** Connects the controller with the view, initializing dependencies and binding data.

### Additional Components
- **widget/**: Reusable UI components/widgets.
- **api/**: API handling utilities.
- **utils/**: Utility classes and functions.
- **service/**: Service classes for specific functionalities.
- **constants/**: Constant values used throughout the app.
- **main.dart:** Entry point of the application.
